Ludum Dare #33 with CodeNMore
Java using LibGDX
Theme: You are the Monster
--------------
Chosen Idea: Codename: "Saucer"
- You are an alien
	TODO:
	- ***Game stops when daytime occurs
		- Every night it gets harder
		- Must eliminate all humans (10 nights?)
	- ***Soldiers trying to destroy ship
	- **Pick up objects with beam and drop them
	- **Show health by lights on saucer
	
	- You abduct humans from the surface
	- Single-screen, can move left/right
		- Shoot down tractor beam
	- Can't abduct fellow aliens on surface
		- You lose humans doing that?
--------------
Ideas:
- Scare people - you are a monster!
	- Must creep up on victims
		- If they turn around you must stop abrupt!
	- In the wilderness, scaring campers
- You turn into a monster during the night
	- Evolve over time?
- You control a virus inside of people
	- Design the virus to have different abilities
	- 0-Gravity sidescrolling
	- 3D-ish avoid white blood cells that will kill you
		- Try to get to the brain of the human
--------------
Goals:
- Stick with a simple-enough idea to complete fully
- Don't try too many new things in programming
